# React TODO App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

## Available Scripts

### `yarn install`

AFter cloning this repo, you'll need to install the node-modules directory as this project uses a few external libraries.  This only needs to be done once.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs both the app in development mode and the required json server for the backend.\
The app is on port 3000 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the Json Server is on port 5000 [http://localhost:5000/tasks/](http://localhost:5000/tasks/).

If you are unsure if the json server is running, check the port above.

### `yarn run json-server`

This runs the json server backend only on port [5000](http://localhost:5000/tasks/).  Run this if you have any issues with not getting any data.
